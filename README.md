# 2-D-Matrix-Class
Repository for my 2-D Matrix Class college mini-project. The project was completed in a team of three people in April 2017 and has been uploaded to github as of June 2018.

This project was completed in C++ with Visual Studio 2015. The objective of this project was to understand the concept of operator overloading in C++.

EDIT (26/06/2018): The project has been recompiled to work with Visual Studio 2017
